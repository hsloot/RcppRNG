The goal of RcppRNG is to explore a templated implementation of Rcpp's internal
generators for sampling. The motivation is to be able to write sampling routines
that are based on native sampling routines (`rexp`, `runif`, ...) in a way that
one can easily switch to an alternative RNG (e.g. `dqrng`).
To achieve this, we borrow some design patterns from [__boost/random__](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_74_0/doc/html/boost_random.html) and enrich these with additional template arguments for distributions, which are central to 
respective simulation strategies.

## Installation

Warning: This package is currently only indented as a showcase. If you want to
replicate the benchmarks in this package, you can install it via

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("hsloot/RcppRNG")
```

## Demonstration

At the moment, only a templated version of the generator for the exponential
function is implemented. The generator template allows variations for difference
RNG classes (which are essentially assumed to behave like `Rcpp::RNGScope`).
I implemented my own version of `Rcpp::RNGScope` with `RcppRNG::RcppRNG` which
contains it's own static counter instead going through R's Call API.
Both version seem to be very similar in their performance.

```{Rcpp}
#include <Rcpp.h>

// [[Rcpp::plugins("cpp14")]]
// [[Rcpp::depends(RcppRNG,dqrng,BH,sitmo)]]

#include <RcppRNG.hpp>

using namespace Rcpp;

using unit_exponential_distribution =
    RcppRNG::unit_exponential_distribution<double>;
using exponential_distribution =
    RcppRNG::exponential_distribution<double, unit_exponential_distribution>;

// [[Rcpp::export(rng=false)]]
NumericVector Rcpp_rexp_RNGScope(R_xlen_t n, double rate = 1.) {
  NumericVector out{no_init(n)};
  Rcpp::RNGScope engine{};
  exponential_distribution exp{rate};
  std::generate(out.begin(), out.end(),
                [&engine, &exp]() { return exp(engine); });

  return out;
}

// [[Rcpp::export(rng=false)]]
NumericVector Rcpp_rexp_RcppRNG(R_xlen_t n, double rate = 1.) {
  NumericVector out{no_init(n)};
  RcppRNG::rng::RcppRNG engine{};
  exponential_distribution exp{rate};
  std::generate(out.begin(), out.end(),
                [&engine, &exp]() { return exp(engine); });

  return out;
}
```

```{r}
n <- 1e1L
lambda <- 0.5
use_seed <- 1623L

set.seed(use_seed)
rexp(n, rate=lambda)

set.seed(use_seed)
Rcpp_rexp_RNGScope(n, rate=lambda)

set.seed(use_seed)
Rcpp_rexp_RcppRNG(n, rate=lambda)


n <- 1e5L
bench::mark(
  rexp(n, rate=lambda),
  Rcpp_rexp_RNGScope(n, rate=lambda),
  Rcpp_rexp_RcppRNG(n, rate=lambda),
  check=FALSE
)
```


## Why is that useful?

For the exponential distribution, obvious to see why this approach constitutes an improvement,
since whenever one wants repeated single exponential samples inside the C++
function, one could resort to

```{Rcpp,eval=FALSE}
scale * ::exp_rand(); // in R_ext/Random.h
```

However, it is much more difficult, if you need repeated single samples from a
discrete distribution (e.g. to sample the transitions in a Markov process). 
At his point you could do somethings like

```{Rcpp, eval=FALSE}
sample(n, 1, false, probs, true)[0]; // probs is NumericVector of size n
```

However, this would construct a `NumericVector` object in each draw. This has
a significant overhead. For the exponential distribution this will be
demonstrated in the following

```{Rcpp}
#include <Rcpp.h>
using namespace Rcpp;

// [[Rcpp::export]]
NumericVector Rcpp_rexp_slow(R_xlen_t n, double rate = 1.) {
  NumericVector out{no_init(n)};
  for (R_xlen_t k=0; k<n; k++)
    out[k] = rexp(1, rate)[0];

  return out;
}
```

```{r}
bench::mark(
  rexp(1e5, 0.5),
  Rcpp_rexp_RNGScope(1e5, 0.5),
  Rcpp_rexp_RcppRNG(1e5, 0.5),
  Rcpp_rexp_slow(1e5, 0.5),
  check=FALSE
)
```

Another problem is, that sampling algorithms might perform internal optimizations 
(in the case of `sample`, probability vectors are sorted), which would have to be 
repreated every time the function is called with the same parameters. 

Finally, we can also want touse another random number generator (e.g. the one from `dqrng`).
This is easily possible with our design pattern without having to duplicate the 
algorithm.

```{Rcpp}
#include <Rcpp.h>

// [[Rcpp::plugins("cpp14")]]
// [[Rcpp::depends(RcppRNG,dqrng,BH,sitmo)]]

#include <RcppRNG.hpp>

using namespace Rcpp;

using unit_exponential_distribution =
    RcppRNG::unit_exponential_distribution<double>;
using exponential_distribution =
    RcppRNG::exponential_distribution<double, unit_exponential_distribution>;

RcppRNG::rng::DQRNG shared_dqrng = RcppRNG::rng::DQRNG{};

// [[Rcpp::export(rng=false)]]
void dqset_seed2(Rcpp::IntegerVector seed, Rcpp::Nullable<Rcpp::IntegerVector> stream = R_NilValue) {
  uint64_t _seed = dqrng::convert_seed<uint64_t>(seed);
  if (stream.isNotNull()) {
    uint64_t _stream = dqrng::convert_seed<uint64_t>(stream.as());
    shared_dqrng.shared_rng->seed(_seed, _stream);
  } else {
    shared_dqrng.shared_rng->seed(_seed);
  }
}

// [[Rcpp::export(rng=false)]]
NumericVector Rcpp_rexp_DQRNG(R_xlen_t n, double rate = 1.) {
  NumericVector out{no_init(n)};
  RcppRNG::rng::DQRNG engine{};
  exponential_distribution exp{rate};
  std::generate(out.begin(), out.end(),
                [&engine, &exp]() { return exp(engine); });

  return out;
}
```

```{r}
dqset_seed2(use_seed)
Rcpp_rexp_DQRNG(1e1, 0.5)

dqset_seed2(use_seed)
Rcpp_rexp_DQRNG(1e1, 0.5)


bench::mark(
  rexp(1e5, 0.5),
  Rcpp_rexp_RNGScope(1e5, 0.5),
  Rcpp_rexp_RcppRNG(1e5, 0.5),
  Rcpp_rexp_DQRNG(1e5, 0.5),
  Rcpp_rexp_slow(1e5, 0.5),
  check=FALSE
)
```

The main benefit of this design is that it allows us to implement new sampling
algorithms, which are based on basic generators (e.g. exp, unif, ...) such that
they can be used with the base R RNG or other RNG's (e.g. dqrng's). An example
is described in a [create new generators](articles/create-new-generators.html).
