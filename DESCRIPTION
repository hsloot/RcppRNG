Description: 
  Templated implementation of Rcpp's random number generators for the 
  exonential distribution. This package is not intended to be used at this 
  point! It's only purpose is to explore a simple mechanism to write 
  sampling routines in R that could easily switch to another encapsulated 
  RNG (e.g. \code{dqrng}).
